                Blini are small russian pancakes usually 2-4 inches in diameter created in Russia in 1000 A.D.
                They were traditionally served with sour cream or salmon but now it served with anything. Caviar,
                condensed milk,
                nutella, etc.

                Olivier is the best russian salad with eveything inside.
                Ham, eggs, potatoes, peas, carrots, pickes, and mayonnaise.
                It is personally one of my favourite salads invented in the 1860s.
                Lucien Olivier who created this salad never told anyone the exact recipe and there are some ingredients
                which are still secret in the original salad.

            <p class="ikrap">
                An expensive but extremely delicious side dish is a caviar or, "ikra" in russian, sandwich.
                Usually served on white break with butter, margarine, or cream cheese and caviar on top.
                My preference is orange caviar and not black although both are good.

            <p class="pelmenip">
                Definitley my favourite food ever pelmeni or dumplins is a russian food created in
                the 14<sup>th</sup> century in Siberia. Pelemeni consist of thin pieces of dough wrapped
                around small pieces of meat. They are usually in the shape of a half moon and are served with sour cream
                or "smetana" in russian.

            <p class="varenikip">
                Very similar to pelmeni and also one of my favourite foods vareniki are the same thing
                as pelmeni with a different filling.
                While in pelmeni it is meat in vareniki it can be either potatoes or jam.
                The word vareniki comes from the Russian word "варенье", <i>varen'ye</i> meaning jam
                because of its filling. Varenikis are also served with sour cream.
